						<h1>Biography</h1><br>

						<p>I am a junior <b>Computer Science</b>, <b>Mathematics</b>, and <b>Physics</b> triple major at <b>Drake University</b>. My interests lie at the intersection of Physics and Computer Science. The ability to build models that accurately depict real life processes is fascinating to me. The research projects I am involved in have allowed me to work with technologies I had only dreamed about. Technology such as the <b>Stampede Supercomputer</b> at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) allows us to generate extremely accurate simulations in a relatively short period of time. When I'm not doing school work or research, I enjoy working on developing a <b>CUDA accelerated Partial Differential Equation Solver</b> with my friends at Washington University as well as building a <b>home automation system</b> for my apartment.</p><br>

						<p>Over the years, I have enjoyed many different activities. In sixth grade, I received a unicycle for Christmas. The next day, I could be seen shoveling the snow off my deck so I had a space to tackle the challenge of learning to ride it. Within a week, I had it down. To this day it is still used as my preferred mode of transportation around campus. </p><br>

						<p>Another hobby of mine is photography. I began doing photography in high school, and since then I have improved immensely. I am currently <i>The Times-Delphic</i> Photo Editor, and last year I won the <b>Iowa College Media Association (ICMA) Best Sports Photograph of the Year</b>. When I am not programming, unicycling, or taking pictures, I can be found grilling, kayaking, camping, and enjoying the company of my friends.</p><br>
