						<h1>Biography</h1><br>

						<p>I am a junior Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics triple at Drake University in Des Moines, IA. My interests lie at the intersection of Physics and Computer Science. Being able to build models that accurately depicts real life processes is fascinating to me. The research projects I am involved in have allowed me to work with technologies I had only dreamed about. Technologies such as the Stampede Supercomputer at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) allows us to generated extremely accurate simulations in a relatively short period of time. When I'm not doing school work or research, I enjoy working on developing a CUDA accelerated Partial Differential Equation Solver with my friends at Washington University as well as building a home automation system for my apartment.</p><br>

						<p>Over the years, I have enjoyed many different activities. In sixth grade, I got a unicycle for Christmas. The next day, I could be seen shoveling the snow off my deck so I had a space to tackle the challenge of learning to ride it. Within a week, I had it down. To this day it is still used as my preferred mode of transportation around campus. </p><br>

						<p>Another hobby of mine is photography. I started getting into photography when I was in high school, and since then I have improved immensely. I am currently The Times-Delphic Photo Editor, and last year I won the Iowa College Media Association (ICMA) Best Sports Photograph of the Year. When I am not programing, unicycling, or taking pictures, I can be found grilling, kayaking, camping, and enjoying the company of my friends.</p><br>
